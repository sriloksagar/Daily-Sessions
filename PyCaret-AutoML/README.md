# PyCaret-AutoML

Automated machine learning (AutoML) basically involves automating the end-to-end process of applying machine learning to real-world problems to generating ML solutions for the data scientist without having to do endless searches on data preparation, data cleansing, model selection,Model building that are actually relevant in the industry. 

PyCaret is an open source, low-code Auto ML(end-to-end machine learning) library in Python that aims to reduce the cycle time from hypothesis to insights and make data scientists more productive in their experiments and allows them to reach conclusions faster due to far less time spent in coding. PyCaret is essentially a Python wrapper around several machine learning libraries and frameworks such as scikit-learn,XGBoost, Microsoft LightGBM, spaCy and many more.
