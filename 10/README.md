# Naive Bayes Classifier

Hey everyone, so today we will be trying to understand how Naive Bayes Classifier works and how to implement a simple Naive Bayes Classifier from scratch.


- Implementing Gaussian Naive Bayes from scratch along with visualisations [link](./NaiveBayesIris.ipynb)
- Explaination [link](./Naive-explained.md)

## Task 

Here we've tried out Gaussian Naive Bayes. Checkout Binomial and Multinomial Naive Bayes and look at sklearn library for direct implementation of these algorithms.
