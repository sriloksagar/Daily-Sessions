    "# Fibonacci Triangle\n",
    "In this notebook, I have demonstrated a funtion to print a Fibonacci triangle. The Fibonacci sequence is generated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X(t+1) = X(t) + X(t-1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "... which means the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers. We therefore need two numbers to start the sequence. Typically, they are 0 and 1. In our example, we will leave it to the user to decide whether they want to start as (0, 1) or (1, 1). Apart from generating the sequence, we also have to print it out as a triangle, given its height ($n$). Thus, we also have to track how many numbers will be printed in each line.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will demonstrate two approaches: one in which we generate the required numbers first and then arrange them in a triangle; the second in which we generate only as many numbers as are needed for a particular line and print all of them out. We'll compare the runtimes for both.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: Runtimes will keep changing over runs based on background processes being performed by your system. Thus runtimes will potentially be very different on differnt systems. "

This could have happened because of the nested loops in Approach 2 (quadratic evolution) while Approach 1 had two independent loops (linear evolution). However, the second approach is less memory consuming, since the list storing the numbers is overwritten in every iteration."
